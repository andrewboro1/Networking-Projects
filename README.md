# Networking-Projects

This repo will highlight networking projects and the resources I use to create them. I will primarily be using Cisco Packet Tracer and will consider making video walkthroughs once I believe my understanding would create an explanation that will be useful for people in their journey. 

The projects will range from simple to complex - Each project will contain the links/videos that have aided my understanding

My Medium page will host blogs where I will share my thoughts on each project in as much detail as my capacity will allow at the time.

Enjoy..
